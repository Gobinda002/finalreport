                            Gosaikunda Trek is religiously vital and naturally richer activity in the northern part
                            of Nepal fallen under Langtang National Park. Situated at an altitude of 4,380 meters,
                            Gosaikunda is the name of a sacred Kunda (Lake) and the main source of the popular
                            Trishuli River. Usually from January to June for about half year the Gosaikunda Lake
                            changes into frozen form offering spectacular views to its visitors.

                            We will start our trip in the early morning. Following our breakfast, our guide
                            will help you to get to Machha Pokhari Bus station. From there we will head
                            towards Dhunche(2,030m/6,660ft) from Kathmandu by bus.

                            On the way, we will be able to enjoy the picturesque settlements and meadows.
                            Through beautiful scenic route and along with immense Trishuli river, it will
                            take us around 5-6 hours to reach Dhunche.

                            Dhunche is a small settlement area and the headquarter of Rasuwa District. After
                            our arrival in Dhunche, we will stroll around the village and spend our time
                            with locals. After spending a wonderful evening with locals, we will stay
                            overnight in a well-maintained tea house.

                            We will start our day 2 trek after our breakfast in Dhunche and we will ascent
                            towards Chandanwari. After hiking roughly for 2 hours, we will reach Deurali
                            (2,500m), a small village on the way to Chandanbari with a few tea houses.

                            Via a beautiful trail, passing through streamlets and cascades we will reach Dhimsa
                            (2,900m) after 3 hours of hiking. From Dhimsa, the climb is slightly difficult, as
                            the trail goes uphill through beautiful pine forests. We have to hike steep uphill
                            sections to reach Chandanwari(3200m), a settlement located at the lap of a pine
                            forest. People also call this place Sing Gompa.

                            Chandanwari has a lot to offer its visitors. A Yak cheese factory and a monastery
                            are the major attractions of Chandanwari. We will try the delicious Yak cheese and
                            visit Sing Gompa.

                            In the evening, after a hearty meal with lots of cheese, we will spend our night in
                            Chandanwari.

                            Following our hearty breakfast in Chandanwari, we will hike uphill to
                            Gosaikunda(4361m). Today the hiking will be comparatively more difficult than
                            yesterday.

                            The trail gradually ascends up from the beginning. We will be hiking via rugged and
                            narrow trail all the way to Gosaikunda. Gradually when we ascend, you will have to
                            walk through barren hills and encounter cold breeze. So, make sure you have clothes
                            warm enough to keep you fine in such a cold environment.

                            After hiking for nearly 1 and a half hour, we will get to Cholangpaty(3500m). Now
                            the views of mountains like Langtang Lirung(7234m), Langtang Ri(7205m),
                            Manaslu(8163m) and Ganesh Himal(7422m) are close and clear.

                            Another 2 hours of the walk will take us to Lauribinayak(3900m). From Lauri Binayak,
                            a panoramic view of Langtang Lirung, Ganesh Himal, Masalu and Langtang Ri can be
                            enjoyed.

                            Then, after hiking up for roughly 2 hours, we will reach a temple called Sakyamuni,
                            which carries both Hindus and Buddhists values. After hiking for half an hour we
                            will see the first lake, Saraswati Kunda, then Bhairav Kunda and the Mighty Lake
                            Gosaikunda. We will visit other nearby lakes and spend the night in a tea house.

                            Dhimsa, and Deurali.

                            Today is the last trekking day. So, enjoy every bit of the trek. Enjoying the
                            alluring views of mountains, pine forest and the flavourful cheese of Chandanwari,
                            we will be hiking downhills. Since we will be descending, hiking will be a bit
                            easier and fun. We will also spot different protected birds in the trail like Wood
                            Snipe, Snow Partridge, Tibetan Snow Cock, etcetera.

                            After hiking roughly for 7 hours we will reach Dhunche.
